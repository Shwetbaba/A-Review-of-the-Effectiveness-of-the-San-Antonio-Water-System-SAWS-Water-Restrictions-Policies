# Analyzing Water Usage Through the Edwards Aquifer
Group Members: Sierra Quevedo, Gino Hernandez, Matthew Belcher, Shwet Bhatt, Jessica Ermovick

Description: Through the precipitation levels and average temperature in  Bexar county, we will determine the changes of water level at the Edwards Aquifer specifically in the well j17. Using datasets through open series such as Edwards Aquifer Authority, U.S. Geological Survey and SAWS we will determine trends of water usage in Bexar county and total water level(j17).

#Outline:

1.	Cleaning raw data taken from different sources.
2.	Merging datasets from clean dataframes.
3.	Explore data and look at correlations specifically between precipitation, temperature, and Edwardâ€™s Aquifer. 
4.	Then using the data taken from the Edwards Aquifer well (j17) we will determine the average water usage of Bexar county residents.
5.	Utilizing Pandas/Matplotlib we will develop and write our code to chart data for presentation.
6.	Based on water usage data, we will determine the coorealtion between the current SAWS drought restriction plans **versus** water levels in Edwards Aquifer well (j17)     **versus** Overall Temperature/Percipitation in Bexar County.
7.	Based on our study, we will analyze if the current water restrictions plan is effective and if not what are the possible challenges.
8.	The group will identify the advantages and limitations of available datasets. 
9.	In addition to this we will identify variables that may help with a deeper dive on this issue.
