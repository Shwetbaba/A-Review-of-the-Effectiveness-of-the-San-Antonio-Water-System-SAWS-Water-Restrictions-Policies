# Analyzing Water Usage Through the Edwards Aquifer
Group Members: Sierra Quevedo, Gino Hernandez, Matthew Belcher, Shwet Bhatt, Jessica Ermovick
Description: Through the precipitation levels and average temperature in  Bexar county, we will determine the water level in the Edwards Aquifer, specifically in the well j17. Using datasets through open series such as Edwards Aquifer Authority and SAWS, we will determine how much water is being used by Bexar county based on the Edwards Aquifer water levels. 
Outline: 
1.	Cleaning raw data taken from different sources
2.	Merging datasets from clean dataframes
3.	Explore data and look at correlations specifically between precipitation, temperature, and Edwardâ€™s Aquifer. 
4.	Then using the data taken from the Edwards Aquifer we will determine the average water usage of Bexar county residents
5.	Based on water usage data, we will determine if the current water restrictions are effective today.
